{
"cryptocurrencies":["BTC","ETH","DASH"]

You have to set the fiat currency/currencies the *Cryptocurrencies* should be displayed in, in the [Config file](https://github.com/JonahKr/Cryptoticker/blob/master/config.json) aswell.

Depending on which, how many *RGB-Pannel/s* and which modules you use, you have to adapt the [startup.sh](https://github.com/JonahKr/Cryptoticker/blob/master/startup.sh) file to your needs.
You can find a detailed tutorial [here](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix).

Last but not least you start the Ticker out of your projectfolder:
`chmod +x startup.sh` - give the script permission to Execute

`sudo ./startup.h`
